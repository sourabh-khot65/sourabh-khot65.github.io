# Professional Experience

## Software Engineer at Tacitbase
*January 2024 – Present*

At Tacitbase, I focus on building systems that make recruitment processes more efficient and data-driven. My work spans across the entire development lifecycle, from understanding user needs to implementing solutions that make a real difference in how companies hire.

### Key Contributions

I've played a central role in developing features that help companies make better hiring decisions. This includes building intelligent search systems that quickly find relevant candidates and implementing AI solutions that help assess candidate fit more effectively.

Some notable projects include:

#### AI-Powered Job Recommendation System
Developed a system that uses advanced language models and semantic search to automatically match candidates with suitable job positions. This significantly reduced the time spent on manual resume screening while improving the quality of matches.

#### Search and Data Management
Implemented high-performance search functionality that handles large volumes of recruitment data efficiently. This system helps recruiters quickly find the right candidates using natural language queries, making the recruitment process more intuitive and effective.

#### Developer Experience
Contributed to improving our development infrastructure, making it easier for the team to build and deploy new features. This included streamlining our local development setup and implementing better monitoring systems to catch issues early.
